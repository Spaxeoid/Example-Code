Question 1: 
    There are not any race conditions in this computation
    because none of the threads are ever modifying an item
    while another thread is trying to read it or modify it
    itself. 
Question 2:
    

Question 3: 
    The result of the computation cannot be saved back into 
    x[i] as that would cause a race condition if one of the 
    other threads needs to use that value which would be 
    very likely in this case. 

Question 4: 
    No, having the temporary array B[*,*] ensures that there
    are no race conditions as it forces the threads to run	
    one row at a time. There would not be a way to ensure
    that the program would run without race conditions if 
    we did not use the temporary array.
