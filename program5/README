The program works by having missionaries and cannibals arrive at the boat crossing. 
The boat then randomly chooses to allow 3 cannibals, 3 missionaries, or 
2 missionaries and a cannibal. 

The program uses a monitor to control who can and can't ride the boat. 
The monitor makes sure that mutual exclusion is held.

The condition variable riding prevents the riding threads from exiting
the condition variable canArrived blocks the cannibal from loading
The condition variable missArrived blocks the missionary from loading. 
The condition variable loading blocks the boat for loading
The condition variable boatWaiting blocks the boat for passengers.
numWaiting holds the number of passengers waiting to ride
cannibalsWaiting holds the number of cannibals waiting
missionariesWaiting holds the number of missionaries waiting
boatState determines if the boat is sailing or waiting
riders shows the number of passengers on the boat

The boat will wait until there are at least 3 waiting passengers and 
that the boat is in the ready state. If there are fewer than 3 
passengers, the boat will wait until there are 3. 

The boat ensures that the riders are safe by having 3 separate options
for when it is ready to load. It will pick one of the 3 options
randomly. 

CannibalArrives checks if it is able to board the boat depending 
on the current number of riders and the boat status. 

MissionaryArrives does the same thing as CannibalArrives. 

BoatReady will allow 3 threads of one of the 3 combinations. MMM, CCC or
MMC. If they are ready, BoatReady allows them to load. Otherwise, it 
blocks. 

BoatDone signals all of the riding threads and releases them so they get
off the boat.
