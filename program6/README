Logic:
    The program will calculate the multiplication
    of 2 matrices using threads and channels. There
    are two types of threads, Edge threads and inside
    threads. The edge threads will send the values
    of the input matrices to the inside threads that
    will calculate the multiplication. Every iteration
    of the inside threads will multiply the sent
    value and add it to its total. It will then send
    that number to the thread to its right and below.

Why it works:
    When the processors get the data, they multiply and
    add that data to what it already had. Doing this will
    calculate all of the elements needed for the output
    matrix.

Variables:
    rightChannels, passes data to the right neighbor
    downChannels, passes data to the neighbor below
    inA, input matrix A
    inB, input matrix B
    otuC, output matrix C

1:
    Thread Pij computes the dot product by receiving
    the data from i and j, multiplies them, then adds
    that data to its sum. Then, the thread passes
    the values to the next thread.

2:
    Synchronous channels are necessary to avoid
    having race conditions. Without sync channels
    the incorrect column/row calculations will be
    made as the column or row data sent to the thread
    could change before the calculation is made.

4:
    The data must be sent in pairs. If either
    value is -1, there are no more pairs and the
    thread can terminate.
